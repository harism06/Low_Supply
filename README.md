# Low Supply

lol just went to a career fair today (i am a cs major btw) and it was rlly crowded. now ive been thinking how we got here in the first place. it all started when i was in middle school. The teachers would show us videos of learning to code and how it could land you a very comfortable job and hows there's free drinks and free food at work (omg, everyone loves free food, right?) now, this advice primarily came from people older than us (often the working class). They would tell us, dont do what i did, and the most phrase that got thrown around at an exponentially increasing job market, 'you should do [so and so] because it is in "high demand"'. the amount of times ive heard "high demand" being desribed as a career field astonishes me. because what normally happens when a new job markets gets created like programming, there are relatively few employees and a lot of work to get done which means employers cant be too picky about who they want to employ, but when they mention everyone to do it and it is in "high demand", then people come flooding in desperation of getting improving the wellbeing of their lives and now we have reached an a job market that suprisingly is still in "high demand". then, why is it so hard to find a job you might ask? well that is because the field is also in high supply as well. and i find it very strange how everyone talks about careers based on their demand and not their supply (it is like the assume the high demand will make it easy for them). on the other hand, supply is how many people are skilled at that task. if you are the only person that knows python, and then suddenly there are people desperate for a person that knows python. that is low supply high demand, which will actually make you employable rather than the current cs/swe job market (which is experiencing a high supply high demand scenario). so, why do i recommend staying away from demand. because the markets is always fluctuated and mastery takes time so when a market is at it peak while you are novice in the subject there is no gurauntee that market will stay that way. but... what you can chase is low supply and the reason i recommend this is puts you in the opposite side of the game board. you are no longer partipating in the competition. rather, you are observing it. you observe how people mimick each other only to realize it ends off with dead end but they couldnt see the dead end because they were surronded with all these people. ok, well how do i find a field that is low supply then? that is actually more simpler than you think. careers or majors that typically tend to be the lowest of supply are normally the hardest ones (with no hanging carrot at the end). now im not saying that pick a career that will guarentee you stay broke for the rest of you life. but, i think it is important to pick a major that you find interesting and is very hard. specifically picking a hard major comes with many overlooked advantages. one of them being no one does them. the second one is most people start to realize what they are capable of once they put themselves in hard situations. let me give an example about the former and then i will come back to the latter. when i was at my new student orientation, they grouped all the stem kids together and majoirty of the students were around half planning on majoring cs, the other half planning on majoring in bio (mainly as a premed) and there were a handful of math and chem majors, and, there was only ONE physics major. the fact that there was only one physics major from a group of a hundred kids means that most people arent willing to do it how hard it is which just straight up eliminates all your competition. I'll move onto the latter point now which is basically about resilience. they beauty of resilience is more about the journey. through each hardship, more and more people give up resulting in even less competition. when your in a class, and with every test grade received, half the class drops out. the acheivment no longer becomes thriving, it becomes surviving. but there is many careers that are in low supply? which one should i pursue? it is important to pursue the path actually hasnt been created and your the first to forge it. so, as your sitting on the other side of the game board and watching over people competing. you have to understand that competing in the first place is useless. there is a saying, "escape competition through authenticity, no one is better than you at being you" so find whatever interests you and just go all in and dont let people convince you otherwise.
